## Overview

This an exercise from the Git and Github Bootcamp course I'm taking through Udemy. The course is instructed by Colt Steele. This is the closing exercise (lesson # 105) from Section 11.

### The challenge

This exercise is to implement the basics of using Github.

-1: Create a new repository locally on your machine.

-2: Create a new Github repository. Name it whatever you want.

-3: Connect your local repo to the Github repo.

-4: Optional: rename the default branch from master to main

-5: Make a new file called favorites.txt  Leave it empty. Make your first commit on the main branch.

-6: Push up your main branch to Github! Make sure you see your empty favorites.txt file on Github

-7: Next, create two branches: foods and movies.

-8: Switch to the foods branch.  Add three (or more) of your favorite foods to the favorites.txt file.  Add and commit your changes on the foods branch.

-9: Switch to the movies branch and add three or more of your favorite movies to the favorites.txt file.  Add and commit your changes on the movies branch.

-10: Push up your foods branch to Github. Make sure you see it on Github.

-11: Push up your movies branch to Github.  Make sure you see it on Github.

-12: Merge the foods branch into the main branch.  Then merge the movies branch into the main branch.  If necessary, resolve conflicts so that you end up with your favorite foods and favorite movies in the same favorites.txt file.

-13: Push up the latest work on your main branch to Github.

### Continued development

There are 20 sections to this course, each with a number of lessons and exercises. This is the final exercise from Section 11. There are previous exercises that I will be posting, as well as exercises that I have done since this one which I will also add. I am more than halfway through this course at this time and not every section has an exercise that could be, or needs to be added to a repository. I will add those exercises that are relevant as it will help solidify my understanding and better develop my skill through practice.
